# Gobar-Gas-Environmental-impact
Gobar gas plants provide a sustainable solution to waste management and energy production. By converting organic waste into biogas, they reduce greenhouse gas emissions and decrease dependency on fossil fuels. They also produce nutrient-rich slurry that can be used as a natural fertilizer, improving soil health and reducing chemical usage.
